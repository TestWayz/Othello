# hello-world
GameState has to be stored and copied somewhere so that we can do the stuff with game state tree

Override the method clone( )in the object GameState

The Game class contains a GameState
The Game class contains the game loop
The Game class contains ArrayList<Controllable>

ComPlay class : turn()
HumPlay class : turn()


Controllable : interface so that ComPlay and HumPlay have the same method name
turn()
